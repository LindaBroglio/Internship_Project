# Internship_Project
This is a github repo for my Internship project, held in [ESTECO](https://www.esteco.com/), in collaboration with the Medical Physics department @ Azienda Sanitaria Universitaria Giuliano Isontina (ASUGI).

The project involves the manipulation of real datasets, the implementation of a pipeline in Python, and comparison of ML models for the classification of a clinical dataset.
